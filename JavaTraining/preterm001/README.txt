In this initial version of the project, I created an application that allows assigning the clients to a seating matrix. The clients are booked to vacant seats in a 10x10 matrix. The clients are randomly assigned to the matrix instead of manual assignment. Hence, thereâ€™s no user interaction in the first pass.
